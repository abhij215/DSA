What is Data Structure:
-----------------------
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
processing, retrieving, and storing data

Classification of Data Structure: 
1) Linear data structure
    - data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its 
      previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.   
    Ex: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

    1.1) Static data structure: 
        -   it has a fixed memory size. easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
            Ex: array

    1.2) Dynamic data structure: 
        -   The size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime. 
            Ex: queue, stack, etc.

2) Non-linear data structure: 
    - data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. 
      In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
    Ex: trees and graphs.


Array Data structure:
---------------------
What is an Array?
An array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory 
locations. It’s one of the most popular and simple data structures and is often used to implement 
other data structures. Each item in an array is indexed starting with 0.

Why Array Data Structures is needed?
The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable..
