What is Sorting?
----------------

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a 
comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order 
of elements in the respective data structure.

Quick sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort - O(nlogn)

Divide And Conquer (DAC)
This technique can be divided into the following three parts:

Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.

Quick sort and Merge sort use DAC

Partition Algorithm:
--------------------

The logic is simple, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of the index of 
smaller (or equal) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap 
the current element with arr[i]. Otherwise, we ignore the current element.
